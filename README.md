Uptown CSS
=====================
Uptown CSS is a semantic toolkit designed to help developers build fully-responsive apps for Shopify's eCommerce platform. This repo is a fork of the original Uptown CSS project to allow the project to be installed via a package manager.

Getting Started
---------------------
You can use this project 2 different ways. Firstly via a package manager like NPM or Yarn. Simply: `npm install danlake/UptownCSS#master` or `yarn add https://github.com/danlake/UptownCSS` within you project and import the master uptown scss file `@import '~uptown-css/styles/uptown';`

Alternatively, you can simply add the stylesheet to your project and begin writing the HTML for your app: <link rel="stylesheet" href="uptown.css">.
